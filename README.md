Using node.js, takes text input and dynamically refreshes the console window pushing new text further up as new lines are introduced

Inspired by the repo: https://github.com/ivanseidel/node-draftlog, I wrote a script that uses draftlog to demonstrate how it's possible to take text input and print it at any level in the console.

My intention is to use this platform with socket.io to build terminal based chat app.

I also plan to use this code to build terminal based server control panels, a more secure way to monitor the backend rather than creating an endpoint to request data from.
